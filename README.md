# Problem Statement
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Many teenagers go through a difficult adolescence period, which can lead to depression. It's usually linked to the emotional and socioeconomic pressures they're
under. This can lead to dangerous and violent conduct, as well as substance misuse and self-harm. Young people use social media to stay in touch with friends, teachers,
family, and other members of their peer group. As a result, it can be utilised as an efficient instrument for disseminating information to those young people who are
affected. So, here we need identify emotional quotient of young people through their Facebook posts.
